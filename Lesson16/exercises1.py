# Define a class named BankAccount with an __init__ method that initializes two
# instance variables: account_holder and balance.

# The class has methods like deposit and withdraw, each of which takes an amount as
# an argument and updates the account balance accordingly. These methods also
# include checks for valid input and available funds.

# The get_balance method allows you to retrieve the account balance.
# We create an Object of the BankAccount class called account1 with an initial balance
# of $1000.
# We deposit $500 and withdraw $200 from the account and print the account
# information.
