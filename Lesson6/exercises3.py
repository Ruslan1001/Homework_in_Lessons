# Exercise 3: Word Finder
# Write a program that takes a list of words and a target word as input.
# The program should find and print all words in the list that contain the
# target word. Use a for loop, the in operator, and an if statement to
# check if the target word is present in each word in the list.
list_1=["python","wordof","schoolon"]
list_2=[]
target_word=input()
for i in list_1:
    if target_word in i:
        list_2.append(i)
print(list_2)
